our father, who art in heaven, I didn't understand
our father, who art in heaven, I had to change my plans

heaven only knows, I'm really on the level
heaven only knows, I'm trying to find a way
heaven only knows, I'm walking down a straight and lonely road today

doesn't matter where I try to be
I'm moving fast but I still can't see the daylight or the rising sun
all I see are the stars above

heaven only knows, I'm really on the level
heaven only knows, I'm trying to find a way
heaven only knows, I'm walking down a straight and lonely road today

I'm sorry that I didn't care, I never saw the signs of beware
didn't listen, didn't think about her
I paid the price of being without her

heaven only knows, I'm really on the level
heaven only knows, I'm trying to find a way
heaven only knows, I'm walking down a straight and lonely road today

if you could turn night into day, I could stop it slipping away

heaven only knows

heaven only knows, I'm really on the level
heaven only knows, I'm trying to find a way
heaven only knows, I'm walking down a straight and lonely road

heaven only knows, heaven only knows, heaven only knows
